MailChimp STS plugin sends emails, generated by WordPress, through MailChimp's Simple Transactional Service API.

== Description ==

Plugin uses [MailChimp Simple Transactional Service](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/sts/1.0/) (which in turn uses [Amazon Simple Email Service](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/)) to send outgoing emails from your Wordpress installation.

Emails can be optionally tracked (for being opened and/or clicked) and are automatically tagged for statistics in MailChimp Transactional Reports.

This plugin is currently released as **beta** for early adopter evaluation and finalizing of initial feature set.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mailchimp-sts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu in WordPress
3. Configure plugin in _Settings > MailChimp STS_

See `readme.html`, supplied with plugin, for detailed instructions on signing up for MailChimp and Amazon.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need MailChimp API key? =

A MailChimp API key is required for access to Simple Transactional Service. STS provides API through which emails are going to be sent.

Use of this plugin requires a MailChimp "Pay-As-You-Go" or "Monthly" account that has been setup to communicate with Amazon SES. See: [How does MailChimp integrate with Amazon SES?](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-does-mailchimp-integrate-with-amazon-ses)

= Why do I need Amazon secret keys? =

Amazon Simple Email Service is used for actual email delivery and pricing, if you need resources above those available in free account.

= Is all email routed through STS? =

Email that uses custom headers and/or attachments is not currently supported by STS API and will be sent directly.
